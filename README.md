## Built With

- Bootstrap
- JQuery

## Usage 

Simply navigate to the url, and enter desired city and state to recieve weather information. Cities outside of the United States will not be available. 

## Notes on Development

This project presented several new obstacles to navigate. Some issues that were overcome and led to new skill sets include:

- Working with API's and making calls
- fetching and parsing data 
- fetching from multiple sources and dealing with varied response time
- Dynamically populating elemnts to the page and populating style at the same time
- Creating edge cases and anticipating user error


## Other Notes:
- Will be using the weather? call and the forecast? call for my api json. After many hours troubleshooting, it is clear the One Call API cannot be accessed without a subscription 
- Because of this, the UV index is not available and will not be included
